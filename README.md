""Android Applications – SIG Projects (2025)""

This repository contains Android applications developed by students in the 2nd year of the Engineering Cycle (Géoinformation) at FST Tangier, Morocco, as part of the Mobile Development module supervised by Ms. Hafida Khalfaoui.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a student project and includes:
1. The complete source code of the Android application.
2. A README.md file describing the project.
3. A screenshots/ folder containing images of the application interface.

This repository serves as a shared space for collaboration, visibility, and recognition of the students’ work.
