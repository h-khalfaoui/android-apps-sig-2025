The "FixRoute" project is an Android mobile app for location-based claim management,  
designed to report road-related issues such as potholes, cracks, or other defects.  
It allows users to submit claims with images and detailed descriptions. Administrators  
can view these claims and decide whether to accept or reject them. Users also have the  
ability to preview accepted claims. Additionally, administrators receive notifications  
for each new claim submitted.
